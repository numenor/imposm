This fork extends the original `imposm` by

* possibility to import route relations

The changes are inspired by those published by `michalmacki <https://bitbucket.org/michalmacki/imposm-routes/>`_.
As those seem to be based on an outdated imposm, they are contained in an hg
repository instead of git, and I saw the need for some slight changes, I
replicated several of his changes.

can import the data into PostgreSQL/PostGIS databases.

services.
